## 🎯 Project Overview

This project solves a **real-world optimization problem**: Where should we place electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in Indore city to maximize profit while serving the maximum number of EVs?

**The Challenge:**
- Indore has many potential locations for charging stations
- Each location has different costs, capacities, and potential demand
- We need to balance: **Cost** (minimize), **Coverage** (maximize), and **Profit** (maximize)
- These objectives often conflict with each other!

**Our Solution:**
We use a **hybrid optimization approach** combining two powerful algorithms:
1. **NSGA-II** (Genetic Algorithm) - Finds the best locations
2. **Benders Decomposition** - Optimizes pricing for those locations

## 🧮 How Calculations Are Done

### **1. Distance Calculation (Haversine Formula)**

**Purpose:** Calculate great-circle distance between two points on Earth's surface.

**Formula:**
```
a = sin²(Δlat/2) + cos(lat1) × cos(lat2) × sin²(Δlon/2)
c = 2 × atan2(√a, √(1-a))
distance = R × c
```

Where:
- `Δlat` = latitude difference in radians
- `Δlon` = longitude difference in radians
- `lat1`, `lat2` = latitudes in radians
- `R` = Earth's radius = 6,371 km

**Implementation:**
```python
def haversine(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):
    R = 6371  # Earth radius in km
    dlat = radians(lat2 - lat1)
    dlon = radians(lon2 - lon1)
    a = sin(dlat/2)**2 + cos(radians(lat1)) * cos(radians(lat2)) * sin(dlon/2)**2
    c = 2 * atan2(sqrt(a), sqrt(1-a))
    return R * c
```

**Why Haversine:**
- Accounts for Earth's curvature (accurate for distances >1 km)
- Standard formula for geographic distance calculations
- More accurate than Euclidean distance for geographic coordinates

---

### **2. Coverage Calculation**

**Purpose:** Count number of EVs within service radius of a charging station.

**Step-by-step process:**

1. **Find zones within 5 km:**
   ```
   For each demand zone i:
       distance = haversine(zone_i, site_j)
       if distance <= 5.0 km:
           include in coverage
   ```

2. **Get zone demand:**
   ```
   zone_demand = zone['demand']
   
   # If demand is zero, estimate from population
   if zone_demand == 0 and zone['population'] > 0:
       zone_demand = zone['population'] × zone['ev_density']
   ```

3. **Spatial interpolation (if still zero):**
   ```
   if zone_demand == 0:
       nearby_demand = []
       for nearby_zone within 10 km:
           if nearby_zone['demand'] > 0:
               weight = 1.0 / (1.0 + distance)
               nearby_demand.append(nearby_zone['demand'] × weight)
       
       if nearby_demand:
           zone_demand = mean(nearby_demand)
       else:
           zone_demand = baseline_demand_per_zone
   ```

4. **Sum coverage:**
   ```
   coverage = sum(zone_demand for all zones within 5 km)
   ```

**Handling edge cases:**
- Zones 5-7 km away: Partial coverage with distance weighting
- Zero demand zones: Spatial interpolation from nearby zones
- Missing population data: Estimated from area × population density

---

### **3. Density Calculation**

**Purpose:** Calculate EV density (EVs per km²) in coverage area.

**Formula:**
```
coverage_area_km2 = π × (service_radius)² = π × 5² = 78.54 km²
density = coverage / coverage_area_km2
```

**Example:**
- Coverage: 500 EVs
- Coverage area: 78.54 km²
- Density: 500 / 78.54 = 6.37 EVs/km²

**Interpretation:**
- Higher density = more concentrated demand = better for station placement
- Lower density = sparse demand = may need larger service radius

---

### **4. Profit Calculation**

**Purpose:** Calculate expected annual profit from operating a charging station.

**Step-by-step calculation:**

**Step 1: Utilization rate**
```
utilization_rate = min(0.5, 0.2 + (coverage / 100.0) * 0.3)
```
- Base utilization: 20%
- Increases by 0.3% per EV covered (up to 50% maximum)

**Step 2: Served EVs**
```
served_evs = coverage × utilization_rate
```

**Step 3: Monthly revenue**
```
charging_sessions_per_ev_per_month = 12
kwh_per_session = 12.5
monthly_kwh_per_ev = 12 × 12.5 = 150 kWh/month

monthly_revenue = served_evs × monthly_kwh_per_ev × price_per_kwh
```

**Step 4: Monthly operating cost**
```
electricity_cost_per_kwh = 4.0 INR
monthly_electricity_cost = served_evs × monthly_kwh_per_ev × electricity_cost_per_kwh
monthly_maintenance = 5000.0 INR

monthly_operating_cost = monthly_electricity_cost + monthly_maintenance
```

**Step 5: Monthly profit**
```
monthly_profit = monthly_revenue - monthly_operating_cost
```

**Step 6: Annual profit**
```
annual_profit = monthly_profit × 12
```

**Example calculation:**
- Coverage: 100 EVs
- Utilization rate: min(0.5, 0.2 + (100/100)*0.3) = 0.5 = 50%
- Served EVs: 100 × 0.5 = 50 EVs
- Monthly revenue: 50 × 150 × ₹10 = ₹75,000
- Monthly electricity cost: 50 × 150 × ₹4 = ₹30,000
- Monthly maintenance: ₹5,000
- Monthly operating cost: ₹30,000 + ₹5,000 = ₹35,000
- Monthly profit: ₹75,000 - ₹35,000 = ₹40,000
- **Annual profit: ₹40,000 × 12 = ₹480,000**

---

### **5. Grid Capacity Calculation**

**Purpose:** Determine if existing grid infrastructure can support charging station load, and calculate upgrade costs if needed.

**Step-by-step process:**

**Step 1: Required load**
```
charger_power_kw = 50 kW per charging point
grid_required_kw = capacity_charging_points × charger_power_kw
```

**Step 2: Available capacity (from OSM)**
```
# Parse voltage from OSM tag
voltage_kv = parse_voltage(osm_tag['voltage'])

# Map voltage to capacity
voltage_capacity_map = {
    33: 6200,   # 33 kV substation
    22: 3500,   # 22 kV substation
    11: 210     # 11 kV transformer
}
base_capacity = voltage_capacity_map[nearest_voltage]

# Apply adjustments
if power_type == 'substation':
    grid_available_kw = base_capacity × 1.2  # +20% buffer
elif power_type == 'transformer':
    grid_available_kw = base_capacity × 0.8  # -20% derating
```

**Step 3: Capacity gap**
```
grid_capacity_gap_kw = grid_available_kw - grid_required_kw
```

**Step 4: Upgrade cost (if needed)**
```
if grid_required_kw > grid_available_kw:
    upgrade_needed_kw = grid_required_kw - grid_available_kw
    grid_upgrade_cost = upgrade_needed_kw × 850 INR/kW
else:
    grid_upgrade_cost = 0
```

**Step 5: Total setup cost**
```
total_setup_cost = setup_cost + grid_upgrade_cost
```

**Example calculation:**
- Capacity: 12 charging points
- Required: 12 × 50 = 600 kW
- Nearest grid: 33 kV substation
- Available: 6,200 × 1.2 = 7,440 kW
- Capacity gap: 7,440 - 600 = 6,840 kW (positive = OK)
- **Upgrade needed:** No (capacity OK)
- **Upgrade cost:** ₹0

**If capacity insufficient:**
- Required: 10,000 kW
- Available: 7,440 kW
- Upgrade needed: 10,000 - 7,440 = 2,560 kW
- **Upgrade cost:** 2,560 × ₹850 = ₹2,176,000

---

### **6. Distance to Grid Calculation**

**Purpose:** Calculate distance from candidate site to nearest grid node.

**Method:**
1. Build spatial index (BallTree) of all grid nodes
2. For each candidate site, find nearest grid node
3. Calculate Haversine distance

**Formula:** Same as distance calculation (Haversine)

**Usage:** Used to estimate cable trenching costs and feasibility

---

### **7. Price Optimization (Benders Decomposition)**

**Purpose:** Find optimal charging price for each site to maximize profit.

**Method:**
1. **Master Problem:** Determine prices (decision variables)
   - Objective: Maximize profit
   - Constraints: Price bounds (₹8-13/kWh)

2. **Subproblem:** Evaluate profit given prices
   - Calculate demand based on prices (with elasticity)
   - Calculate revenue and costs
   - Return profit

3. **Benders Cuts:** Add constraints to master problem
   - If subproblem shows low profit, add cut: "Prices must be higher"
   - Iteratively refine solution

4. **Convergence:** Repeat until profit improvement < threshold

**Price adjustment formula:**
```
base_price = 10.0 INR/kWh
demand_density = sum(demand for zones within 5 km)
price_adjustment = min(demand_density / 1000.0, 3.0)
optimal_price = base_price + price_adjustment
```

**Demand elasticity:**
```
price_factor = (price / 10.0)^(-0.5)
adjusted_demand = original_demand × price_factor
```
- If price increases 10%, demand decreases ~5%

---

### **8. Site Selection (NSGA-II)**

**Purpose:** Find optimal combination of sites to select.

**Multi-objective optimization:**

**Objective 1: Minimize Cost**
```
total_cost = sum(setup_cost for all selected sites)
```

**Objective 2: Maximize Coverage**
```
total_coverage = 0
for each demand zone:
    if zone is within 5 km of ANY selected site:
        total_coverage += zone['demand']
```

**Objective 3: Minimize Average Distance**
```
total_distance = 0
zones_covered = 0
for each demand zone:
    nearest_site = min(distance to all selected sites)
    if nearest_site <= 5 km:
        total_distance += nearest_site
        zones_covered += 1

avg_distance = total_distance / zones_covered
```

**NSGA-II process:**
1. Initialize population of 50 random site selections
2. Evaluate each solution on 3 objectives
3. Rank by Pareto dominance (non-dominated sorting)
4. Select best solutions for next generation
5. Apply crossover and mutation to create new solutions
6. Repeat for 50 generations
7. Return Pareto-optimal solutions

**Pareto dominance:**
- Solution A dominates B if: A is better in ALL objectives
- Pareto front = set of non-dominated solutions
- Different solutions represent different trade-offs

---

### **9. Best Solution Selection**

**Purpose:** Select single best solution from Pareto front.

**Method: Weighted scoring**
```
# Normalize objectives to [0, 1]
cost_norm = (cost - cost_min) / (cost_max - cost_min)
coverage_norm = (coverage - coverage_min) / (coverage_max - coverage_min)
profit_norm = (profit - profit_min) / (profit_max - profit_min)

# Weighted score (higher is better)
weights = [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]  # [profit, coverage, -cost]
score = (profit_norm × 0.5) + (coverage_norm × 0.3) + ((1 - cost_norm) × 0.2)

# Select solution with highest score
best_solution = argmax(scores)
```

**Weights rationale:**
- Profit (50%): Primary objective - ensures financial viability
- Coverage (30%): Secondary objective - ensures good service
- Cost (20%): Tertiary objective - minimizes investment

    'longitude': 75.8889,
    'population': 45000,
    'demand': 1350.0,  # population × ev_density (3%)
    'ev_density': 0.03
}

# Candidate site example
site = {
    'site_id': 108,
    'latitude': 22.7196,
    'longitude': 75.8577,
    'capacity': 12,  # 12 charging points
    'setup_cost': 2500000.0,  # ₹2.5M
    'site_type': 'mall',
    'name': 'C21 Mall',
    'nearest_grid_id': 5,
    'grid_available_kw': 6200,
    'grid_required_kw': 600,
    'grid_upgrade_cost': 0.0
}

# Grid node example
grid_node = {
    'grid_id': 5,
    'name': 'AB Road Substation',
    'latitude': 22.7220,
    'longitude': 75.8500,
    'power': 'substation',
    'voltage_kv': 33.0,
    'available_kw': 6200
}
```

#### **Step 2: Distance Calculation**

**What it does:**
- Calculates great-circle distance between every demand zone and every candidate site
- Uses **Haversine formula** (accounts for Earth's curvature)
- Stores in `distance_matrix[i, j]` = distance from zone i to site j (in km)

**Formula:**
```
a = sin²(Δlat/2) + cos(lat1) × cos(lat2) × sin²(Δlon/2)
c = 2 × atan2(√a, √(1-a))
distance = R × c  (R = 6371 km, Earth's radius)
```

**Why it matters:**
- Determines which EVs can be served by which stations (5km service radius)
- Used to calculate coverage for each site

#### **Step 3: Hybrid Optimization** (`hybrid_optimizer.py`)

**What it does:**
- Combines NSGA-II (location selection) and Benders Decomposition (pricing)

**NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II):**
- **Purpose**: Find best combinations of sites to select
- **How it works**:
  1. Creates initial population of random site selections
  2. Evaluates each solution on 3 objectives: cost, coverage, distance
  3. Ranks solutions by dominance (Pareto front)
  4. Selects best solutions for next generation
  5. Applies crossover and mutation to create new solutions
  6. Repeats for 50 generations
- **Output**: 50 Pareto-optimal solutions (different trade-offs)

**Benders Decomposition** (`benders_decomposition.py`):
- **Purpose**: Optimize pricing for a given set of selected sites
- **How it works**:
  1. Takes a site selection from NSGA-II
  2. Solves pricing subproblem (maximize profit given demand)
  3. Updates master problem with Benders cuts
  4. Iterates until convergence (30 iterations)
- **Output**: Optimal price for each selected site

**Key Functions:**
- `HybridOptimizer.solve()`: Main optimization loop
- `NSGA2Optimizer.optimize()`: Runs NSGA-II
- `BendersOptimizer.solve()`: Optimizes pricing

#### **Step 4: Solution Selection**

**What it does:**
- From 50 Pareto-optimal solutions, selects the best one
- Uses weighted scoring: `score = 0.3 × (normalized_profit) + 0.4 × (normalized_coverage) + 0.3 × (1 - normalized_cost)`
- Best solution = highest score

**Why this approach:**
- Pareto front shows all possible trade-offs
- Weighted scoring lets you prioritize (e.g., more weight on profit if profit-focused)

#### **Step 5: Metrics Calculation** (`site_metrics_calculator.py`)

**What it does:**
- Calculates detailed metrics for each selected site
- **Centralized calculator** ensures consistency across CSV, visualization, and HTML report

**Key Metrics:**

1. **Coverage (EVs)**
   - **Definition**: Number of EVs within 5km service radius
   - **Calculation**:
     ```python
     coverage = 0
     for each demand zone within 5km:
         zone_demand = zone['demand']
         if zone_demand == 0:
             # Estimate from population
             zone_demand = zone['population'] × zone['ev_density']
         if zone_demand == 0:
             # Spatial interpolation from nearby zones
             zone_demand = interpolate_from_nearby_zones()
         coverage += zone_demand
     ```
   - **Spatial Interpolation**: If a zone has zero demand but is near zones with demand, we estimate demand using inverse distance weighting

2. **Density (EVs/km²)**
   - **Definition**: Average EV density in coverage area
   - **Calculation**: `density = coverage / (π × 5²)` = `coverage / 78.54 km²`
   - **Interpretation**: Higher density = more concentrated demand

3. **Annual Profit (₹)**
   - **Definition**: Expected annual profit from operating the station
   - **Calculation Steps**:
     ```python
     # Utilization rate (20-50% based on coverage)
     utilization_rate = min(0.5, 0.2 + (coverage / 100.0) * 0.3)
     
     # EVs that actually use the station
     served_evs = coverage × utilization_rate
     
     # Monthly revenue
     monthly_kwh_per_ev = 12 sessions/month × 12.5 kWh = 150 kWh/month
     monthly_revenue = served_evs × 150 kWh × price_per_kwh
     
     # Monthly cost
     electricity_cost = served_evs × 150 kWh × ₹4/kWh
     maintenance = ₹5,000/month
     monthly_cost = electricity_cost + maintenance
     
     # Monthly profit
     monthly_profit = monthly_revenue - monthly_cost
     
     # Annual profit
     annual_profit = monthly_profit × 12
     ```
   - **Assumptions**:
     - Average EV charges 12 times/month
     - 12.5 kWh per session (150 kWh/month total)
     - Electricity cost: ₹4/kWh
     - Fixed maintenance: ₹5,000/month

4. **Demand Category**
   - **High**: ≥100 EVs coverage
   - **Medium**: 50-99 EVs coverage
   - **Low**: 1-49 EVs coverage
   - **Very Low**: 0 EVs coverage (strategic/connectivity sites)

#### **Step 6: Visualization & Reports**

**What it does:**
- Creates visual maps, plots, CSV, and HTML reports
- All use the same centralized calculator for consistency

1. **Initialization**: Creates random population of site selections
   - Each individual = binary array (1 = select site, 0 = don't select)
   - Population size = 50

2. **Evaluation**: Calculates objectives for each solution
   - Cost: Total setup cost
   - Coverage: Total EVs covered
   - Distance: Average distance to stations

3. **Non-dominated Sorting**: Ranks solutions by Pareto dominance
   - Solution A dominates B if: A is better in all objectives
   - Creates Pareto fronts (Front 1 = best, Front 2 = second best, etc.)

4. **Selection**: Selects best solutions for next generation
   - Uses tournament selection
   - Prefers solutions in better fronts

5. **Crossover & Mutation**: Creates new solutions

2. **Subproblem**: Evaluates profit given prices
3. **Benders Cuts**: Adds constraints to master problem
4. **Iterate**: Until convergence (30 iterations)

**Pricing Model:**
- Base price: ₹10/kWh
- Price adjustment based on demand density
- Higher demand = can charge higher price (up to ₹13/kWh)

**Key Functions:**

### NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II)

**What it is:**
A multi-objective genetic algorithm that finds Pareto-optimal solutions.

**How it works:**

1. **Initialization**
   - Creates 50 random solutions (each = binary array: 1 = select site, 0 = don't)
   - Each solution represents a set of selected sites

2. **Evaluation**
   - For each solution, calculates 3 objectives:
     - **Cost**: Sum of setup costs for selected sites
     - **Coverage**: Total EVs within 5km of any selected site
     - **Distance**: Average distance from EVs to nearest station

3. **Non-dominated Sorting**
   - Ranks solutions by Pareto dominance:
     - Solution A dominates B if: A is better in ALL objectives
     - Creates fronts: Front 1 (best), Front 2 (second best), etc.

4. **Selection**
   - Uses tournament selection to pick parents
   - Prefers solutions in better fronts

5. **Crossover & Mutation**
   - **Crossover**: Combines two parent solutions (e.g., take first half from parent 1, second half from parent 2)
   - **Mutation**: Randomly flips some site selections (1→0 or 0→1)

6. **Repeat**
   - For 50 generations
   - Each generation improves the population

**Output:**
- 50 Pareto-optimal solutions
- Each represents a different trade-off (e.g., low cost vs high coverage)

### Benders Decomposition

**What it is:**
A mathematical optimization technique for solving two-stage problems.

**How it works:**

1. **Master Problem**: Determines prices (decision variables)
   - Objective: Maximize profit
   - Constraints: Price bounds (₹8-13/kWh)

2. **Subproblem**: Evaluates profit given prices
   - Calculates demand based on prices
   - Calculates revenue and costs
   - Returns profit

3. **Benders Cuts**: Adds constraints to master problem
   - If subproblem shows low profit, add cut: "Prices must be higher"
   - Iteratively refines solution

4. **Convergence**
   - Repeats for 30 iterations
   - Stops when profit improvement < threshold

**Output:**
- Optimal price for each selected site
- Prices range from ₹10-10.2/kWh (competitive market pricing)

## 📐 Metrics Calculation Explained

### Coverage Calculation (Detailed)

**Step 1: Find zones within 5km**
```python
for each demand zone:
    distance = haversine_distance(zone, site)
    if distance <= 5.0:  # Within service radius
        # Include in coverage
```

**Step 2: Get zone demand**
```python
zone_demand = zone['demand']
if zone_demand == 0:
    # Try to estimate from population
    if zone['population'] > 0:
        zone_demand = zone['population'] × zone['ev_density']
```

**Step 3: Spatial interpolation (if still zero)**
```python
if zone_demand == 0:
    # Find nearby zones with demand (within 10km)
    nearby_demand = []
    for nearby_zone:
        if distance <= 10.0 and nearby_zone['demand'] > 0:
            weight = 1.0 / (1.0 + distance)  # Inverse distance weighting
            nearby_demand.append(nearby_zone['demand'] × weight)
    
    if nearby_demand:
        zone_demand = mean(nearby_demand)  # Weighted average
    else:
        zone_demand = baseline_demand  # Conservative estimate
```

**Step 4: Sum coverage**
```python
coverage = sum(zone_demand for all zones within 5km)
```

### Profit Calculation (Detailed)

**Step 1: Utilization rate**
```python
# Base utilization: 30%
# Higher coverage = higher utilization (up to 50%)
utilization_rate = min(0.5, 0.2 + (coverage / 100.0) * 0.3)
```

**Step 2: Served EVs**
```python
served_evs = coverage × utilization_rate
```

**Step 3: Monthly revenue**
```python
# Average EV: 12 sessions/month × 12.5 kWh = 150 kWh/month
monthly_kwh_per_ev = 12.0 × 12.5  # 150 kWh/month
monthly_revenue = served_evs × monthly_kwh_per_ev × price_per_kwh
```

**Step 4: Monthly cost**
```python
electricity_cost = served_evs × monthly_kwh_per_ev × 4.0  # ₹4/kWh
maintenance = 5000.0  # Fixed ₹5,000/month
monthly_cost = electricity_cost + maintenance
```

**Step 5: Monthly profit**
```python
monthly_profit = monthly_revenue - monthly_cost
```

**Step 6: Annual profit**
```python
annual_profit = monthly_profit × 12
```

**Example:**
- Coverage: 100 EVs
- Utilization: 30% → Served: 30 EVs
- Monthly revenue: 30 × 150 × ₹10 = ₹45,000
- Monthly cost: (30 × 150 × ₹4) + ₹5,000 = ₹23,000
- Monthly profit: ₹45,000 - ₹23,000 = ₹22,000
- **Annual profit: ₹264,000**

### Grid Capacity & Upgrade Calculation

**Step 1: Required load from chargers**
```python
charger_power_kw = 50  # assumed DC fast charger size
required_kw = capacity_charging_points * charger_power_kw
```

**Step 2: Available grid capacity**
- Each grid node carries a voltage tag (33 kV, 11 kV, etc.) from OSM
- We map voltage → typical available kW (e.g., 33 kV ≈ 6,200 kW, 11 kV ≈ 210 kW)
- Substations get a +20% buffer, transformers a -20% derating

**Step 3: Capacity gap & upgrade cost**
```python
upgrade_needed_kw = max(0, required_kw - available_kw)
upgrade_cost_inr = upgrade_needed_kw * 850  # ₹850 per kW for distribution upgrades
```

**Step 4: Distance to grid node**
- Nearest substation/transformer found using a BallTree on lat/lon
- Distance recorded in km to highlight trenching / cabling effort

**Step 5: Total investment per site**
```python
total_setup_cost = setup_cost + upgrade_cost_inr
```

**Interpretation:**
- `grid_capacity_ok = True` → existing grid can absorb the load
- `grid_capacity_ok = False` → allocate upgrade budget before construction
- High upgrade cost spots pinpoint weak feeders to reinforce or avoid

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'geopandas'"**
- **Solution**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**2. "OSM data download is slow"**
- **Solution**: This is normal. OSM data download takes 1-2 minutes. Be patient.

**3. "Zero coverage/profit at some sites"**
- **Explanation**: Some sites may be selected for strategic reasons (connectivity, future growth)
- **Solution**: Check `min_distance` in CSV. If >5km, site is outside service radius.

**4. "All sites show high profit"**
- **Fixed**: Updated profit calculation to be more realistic (150 kWh/month instead of 200)

**5. "Distance matrix shape mismatch"**
- **Solution**: Ensure `distance_matrix.shape == (n_zones, n_sites)`. Check data loading.

**6. "Optimization takes too long"**
- **Solution**: Reduce `nsga2_generations` or `benders_iterations` in `main.py`

### Getting Help

- Check error messages carefully
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Ensure internet connection for OSM data
- Check that Indore coordinates are correct (22.7196°N, 75.8577°E)
